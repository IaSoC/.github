## Where you place your imagination /

> [cte] Yeah there should be a logo for this organization, but it is on the paper for now...Maybe sometime...

IaSoC is a virtual organization located in Ellenvia and operates in the real world.

We works on a wide range of directions, from the games, to the Information Technology, and so on.

There's no limitation on everything, which gives the individuals the largest freedom to do everything they want to.

> Disclaimer: We don't like some famous organizations, like [U4](https://u4group.github.io/HomePage/), which accepts participations by email. 
> 
> Instead, you need to be invited by one of the IaSoC members. So Good Luck xD.

More information can be found in other document in the profile directory.

Have fun with our product xDDDD
